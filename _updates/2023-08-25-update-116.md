Do you want to contribute to Tari? Contibuting to a crypto project can be daunting. For that reason we've put together a [Reviewer's Guide](https://github.com/tari-project/tari/pull/5664) to help you get started. It's by no means a complete set of rules to follow, but this guide aims to help new contributors think about vulnerabilities when coding and reviewing pull requests. With the current code audits continuing and as we get closer to a release candidate, it is vitally important to find bugs and vulnerabilities.

In addition to the reviewer's guide, we've started creating some [diagrams](https://github.com/tari-project/tari/pull/5651) to help new developers get aquainted to the code base. Diagramming a whole system will take a while, so it's a work in progress right now, but we'll keep adding.
