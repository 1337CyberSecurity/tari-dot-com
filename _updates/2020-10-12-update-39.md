## tl;dr Tari Base Node v0.5.6 released, Testnet reset 28 October 2020

In release v0.5.6, a number of fixes were applied to the distributed hash table (DHT) network and propagation
of blocks. These aim to solve the problem of nodes getting isolated from the network. There was also a major fix
to the difficulty calculation in the Monero merge mined blocks.

It's worth noting that there will be a network upgrade from block 120,000, where some new rules will apply. Nodes running
v0.5.6 should upgrade fine, older nodes will move onto their own chain (Hopefully, it's still testnet after all).

Also, **the current testnet will be reset around 28 October 2020**. If you have any testnet tXTR, you should use it before then
at the TTL store.
