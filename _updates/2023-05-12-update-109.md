The Tari network has three primary clients, namely Validator Nodes, Wallets, and Indexers, excluding the Minotari network clients. Validator nodes execute transactions and reach an agreement using a variant of the Cerberus consensus, while wallets serve as an interface for clients. However, what is the role of Indexers?

To enable the Tari network to process thousands of transactions per second, the network has been sharded. This means that no validator node stores the entire network's data and would probably be unable to do so, even if it wanted to. Moreover, specific assets and contracts are spread across different shards to avoid overloading some shards while leaving others idle. However, this also means that if you're only interested in a single asset, your wallet would need to request the data for that asset from every shard. To address this issue, Tari has developed an Indexer that can be run locally to scan the shards and download all data related to assets you're interested in.

Indexers function similarly to base nodes for the Minotari layer, providing a unified view of an asset as though it were a dedicated blockchain.

As an example, suppose you run a real-world coffee shop and want to create a loyalty points system. In that case, you can use the fungible loyalty points contract template and publish it on the network. Your customers can interact with and store their loyalty points in Tari DAN wallets. Finally, to validate or display transactions for whatever reason, you can set up a Tari Indexer node to monitor the resource and component address of your contract.

The development of the Indexer is still ongoing, with the Tari development community working on adding GraphQL and event scanning capabilities. If you'd like to try it out, you can find it here: https://github.com/tari-project/tari-dan/tree/development/applications/tari_indexer.
